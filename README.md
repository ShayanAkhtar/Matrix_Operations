# Matrix_Operations

This program is written in C++ and provides various operations on matrices. It allows users to perform operations such as transposing a matrix, calculating the sum of rows and columns, and performing binary operations (multiplication, addition, and subtraction) on two matrices.

Features:
1. Matrix Input: Users can input matrices by specifying the number of rows and columns and entering the elements of the matrix.
2. Matrix Display: Matrices can be displayed on the console, showing the elements in a tabular format.
3. Matrix Transpose: The program can calculate the transpose of a given matrix.
4. Sum of Rows and Columns: Users can calculate the sum of each row and column in a matrix.
5. Binary Operations: The program allows users to perform binary operations on two matrices, including matrix multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

Usage:
1. Input Matrix: Enter the number of rows and columns for each matrix and provide the elements.
2. Transpose: Select option 1 to calculate the transpose of a matrix.
3. Sum of Rows and Columns: Choose option 2 to calculate the sum of rows and columns in a matrix.
4. Binary Operations: Select option 3 to perform binary operations on two matrices. You can multiply, add, and subtract matrices.
5. Exit: Enter option 5 to exit the program.

This program is helpful for computer science students and developers working with matrices. It demonstrates concepts of matrix manipulation and provides a practical implementation in C++.
