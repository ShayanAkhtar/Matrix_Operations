# Operations on Matrices

This repository contains a C++ program that performs various operations on matrices. It provides functionalities such as matrix transpose, sum of rows and columns, and binary operations on matrices (multiplication, addition, and subtraction).

## Program Overview

The program is structured as follows:

- The user is prompted to choose an operation to perform on matrices.
- If the user selects the transpose operation, the program takes input for a matrix and displays its transpose.
- If the user selects the sum of rows and columns operation, the program takes input for a matrix and calculates the sum of each row and column.
- If the user selects the binary operations on matrices, the program takes input for two matrices and provides a menu to perform multiplication, addition, or subtraction between the matrices.
- The program validates inputs and handles errors for incompatible matrix sizes.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the compiled program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose and perform operations on matrices.

## Dependencies

This program does not have any external dependencies and can be compiled and run using a standard C++ compiler.
